# Progress Analysis Script

This script automatically analyzes the repository to generate real-time progress data for the GitHub Pages infographic.

## Usage

```bash
# Generate progress data
python3 scripts/generate_progress_data.py

# Output will be saved to public/progress-data.json
```

## What it analyzes

### Feature Implementation (40% of overall score)
- Checks for presence of core feature files
- Validates implementation of key components
- Tracks completion of major functionality

### Test Coverage (30% of overall score)  
- Counts total test functions across all test files
- Analyzes test file structure and completeness
- Assesses testing framework maturity

### Documentation (30% of overall score)
- Validates presence of required documentation files
- Calculates documentation completeness percentage
- Measures total documentation size and quality

### Component Maturity
Individual component scores based on:
- **Core System**: Feature completion + test coverage
- **Documentation**: Completeness of required docs
- **Testing Framework**: Test coverage and quality
- **Automated Routing**: Fixed score based on implementation
- **Integration Layer**: Fixed score based on available integrations  
- **Security & Auth**: Fixed score based on documented features

## Output Format

The script generates `public/progress-data.json` with:

```json

  }
}
```

## Integration

The script is automatically executed by the GitHub Actions workflow (`static.yml`) during deployment to ensure the progress data is always current when the site is updated.
