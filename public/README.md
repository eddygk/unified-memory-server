# Unified Memory Server - Project Status Infographic

This directory contains the static GitHub Pages site for the Unified Memory Server project.

## Contents

- `index.html` - Interactive project status infographic with real-time charts, progress indicators, and roadmap
- `progress-data.json` - Automatically generated progress data based on repository analysis
- `.nojekyll` - Prevents GitHub Pages from processing the site with Jekyll

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process includes:

1. **Repository Analysis**: Automated script analyzes the codebase to calculate real progress metrics
2. **Data Generation**: Progress data is generated in JSON format based on:
   - Feature implementation status
   - Test coverage and quality
   - Documentation completeness
   - Component maturity levels
   - Recent development activity
3. **Static Site Deployment**: Updated infographic with real-time data is deployed to GitHub Pages

## Live Site

The infographic is available at: https://eddygk.github.io/unified-memory-server/

## Features

### Automated Progress Tracking
- **Real-time Progress**: Overall project completion percentage calculated from actual repository metrics
- **Component Maturity**: Dynamic assessment of individual project components
- **Live Data**: Progress indicators update automatically on each deployment
- **Fallback Support**: Static fallback values ensure the site works even if dynamic data is unavailable

### Interactive Visualizations
- Project progress overview with dynamic percentage
- Component maturity comparison charts
- System architecture flow diagrams  
- Technology ecosystem overview
- Development roadmap with completion status

### Technical Implementation
- Built with Chart.js for interactive charts
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic data loading
- Python script for repository analysis
- GitHub Actions integration for automated updates

## Data Sources

The progress indicators are calculated from:
- **Features**: Implementation status of core functionality (40% weight)
- **Tests**: Test coverage and framework maturity (30% weight)  
- **Documentation**: Completeness of project documentation (30% weight)
- **Activity**: Recent development activity and commit history

Progress data is automatically regenerated on each deployment to ensure accuracy.
